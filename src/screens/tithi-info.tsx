        <InfoParagraph>
          Tithis can start and end at any time, lasting between 18 to 24 hours
          due to the elliptical nature of the moon's orbit.
        </InfoParagraph>
        <InfoParagraph>
          This makes it difficult to predict Tithi for a day without
          evaluating the moon's position at sunrise relative to the sun.
        </InfoParagraph>
        <InfoParagraph>
          Due to historical conventions, the Tithi at sunrise is considered
          the Tithi for the day.

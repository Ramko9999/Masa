        Privacy Policy
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        This privacy policy applies to the Masa app (hereby referred to as
        "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Ramki Pitchala &
        Rohan Shiva (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free
        service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4" style="font-family: var(--font-serif)">
        Information Collection and Use
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The Application is designed to run entirely on your device. It does <strong
          >not</strong
        > collect, store, or transmit any personal information or usage data to any
        external servers or third parties.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The only permission the Application requests is access to your <strong
          >device's location</strong
        >, which is used solely for calculating Panchanga attributes such as
        Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga, Karana, Vaara, and festival timings â€” all of
        which depend on your geographic position.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Your location data never leaves your device.</strong></li>
        <li>It is used only for calendar-related calculations.</li>
        <li>
          No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          The app does <strong>not</strong> use any analytics, ads, or third-party
          tracking.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4" style="font-family: var(--font-serif)">
        Third Party Access
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The Application does <strong>not</strong> share any user data with third
        parties. Since no data is collected or stored, there is nothing to share
        or transmit externally.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4" style="font-family: var(--font-serif)">
        Opt-Out Rights
      </h2>

        You can stop all use of the Application by simply uninstalling it. You
        may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your
        mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4" style="font-family: var(--font-serif)">
        Data Retention Policy
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The Application does not collect or retain any user data. Since there is
        no user data stored, there is nothing to delete or manage.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4" style="font-family: var(--font-serif)">
        Children
      </h2>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4" style="font-family: var(--font-serif)">
        Security
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The Application runs entirely on the user's device and does not transmit
        any data. There is no remote data storage, reducing the risk of data
        leaks or unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4" style="font-family: var(--font-serif)">
        Changes

        Service Provider will notify you of any changes by updating this page.
        You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
        changes. Continued use of the Application after any changes will
        constitute your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.

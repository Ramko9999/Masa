# Tithi
- A Tithi is like a "lunar day" in the Hindu calendar.
- It measures the Moon's journey as it moves approximately 12 degrees away from the Sun.

## Why is Tithi Important?
- Tithis help us decide when to celebrate festivals and perform religious rituals.
- They are a key part of the Hindu calendar, guiding daily life and spiritual practices.

## How Does a Tithi Work?
- Each month, called a **Chandra Masa**, has 30 Tithis.
- A Chandra Masa is divided into two halves:
  - **Shukla Paksha**: From new moon to full moon, ending with **Purnima** (the full moon day).
  - **Krishna Paksha**: From full moon to new moon, ending with **Amavasya** (the new moon day).
- Tithis can occur at any time during the day or night. The transition from one tithi to another can happen at varying times, which affects the way festivals and rituals are scheduled.

## Why 30 Tithis and 12 Degrees?
- The Moon's orbit around Earth is not a perfect circle; it's an elongated ellipse. This means the Moon sometimes moves faster and sometimes slower.
- The concept of 30 Tithis arises because the Moon takes about 30 days to catch up to the Sun's position in the sky, completing a full cycle.
- Each Tithi represents approximately 12 degrees of this journey, but it's not exactly 360 degrees due to the elliptical orbit.

## Special Tithis
- **Amavasya**: The new moon day, part of Krishna Paksha, when the Moon is not visible.
- **Purnima**: The full moon day, part of Shukla Paksha, when the Moon is fully visible.

## The Moon's Variable Speed and Tithi Dynamics
- **Variable Speed**: Because the Moon's orbit is elliptical, its speed varies. It moves faster when closer to Earth and slower when farther away.
- **Overlay on Solar Days**: Tithis are overlaid onto solar days, which are based on the Earth's rotation. This can lead to:
  - **Repeated Tithis (Adhika Tithi)**: When the Moon moves slowly, the same Tithi can occur on two consecutive solar days.
  - **Skipped Tithis (Kshaya Tithi)**: When the Moon moves quickly, it can skip a Tithi entirely between two sunrises.
- **Determining the Current Tithi**: The Tithi for any given day is usually determined by the Tithi present at sunrise. This means that even if a Tithi changes during the day, the one at sunrise is observed.

## Naming of Tithis
- Tithis are named using Sanskrit counting numbers: Prathama (1st), Dwitiya (2nd), etc.

## Chandra Masa and Chandra Varsha
- **Chandra Masa**: A month in the lunar calendar, consisting of 30 Tithis.
- **Chandra Varsha**: A lunar year made up of 12 Chandra Masas, falling short of a solar year by about 11 days.
- This system forms the basis for Hindu festivals and religious observances.
